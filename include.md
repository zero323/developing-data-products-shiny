### Welcome to storm database explorer

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Full description of the processing workflow is available on [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/zero323/18294).

Source code is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/zero323/developing-data-products-shiny).
